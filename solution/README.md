# Generating the CSV file using gencsv.sh
- use command ** sudo chmod+ x gencsv.sh **
- run the script file using command ** ./gencsv.sh 10 **. Here 10 represents the number of entries we want to be generated. Also make sure you are in the right path while running this command.
- inputFile.csv will be generated in the same directory as of the script file.
